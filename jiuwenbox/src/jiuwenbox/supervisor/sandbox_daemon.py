"""Long-running in-sandbox daemon that handles ``exec`` requests.

The previous implementation was a placeholder that just blocked on
``signal.pause`` so the sandbox lifecycle stayed alive. To make exec
calls cheap, the daemon now hosts a Unix-socket IPC server inside the
sandbox: box-server connects to the socket and sends ``exec`` requests
that the daemon services by ``fork+exec``-ing the user command. Because
the daemon already has bubblewrap's namespaces, mounts, seccomp, and
Landlock applied, every spawned child inherits the same isolation - the
expensive ``bwrap`` setup happens once per sandbox lifecycle instead of
once per exec.

How the daemon is started
-------------------------
Inside the sandbox the Landlock launcher (see ``landlock_launcher.py``)
reads this script's source from ``/jiuwenbox`` *before* applying
Landlock and then runs the daemon code with ``compile``/``exec`` in the
launcher's own Python process. There is **no** second ``execve`` after
Landlock is locked in, which is what allows the ``/jiuwenbox`` directory
to be omitted from the Landlock allowlist: nothing in the sandbox needs
to read the daemon script from disk after Landlock applies. From the
kernel's point of view the daemon and the launcher are the same Linux
process (PID 1 of the sandbox PID namespace). The directory is reserved
by ``PolicyEngine`` so user policies cannot reference it; see
``_RESERVED_SANDBOX_PATHS`` in ``jiuwenbox/server/policy_engine.py``.

The control socket itself lives on the **host** filesystem; box-server
``bind()``s and ``listen()``s before spawning bubblewrap, then passes
the listener file descriptor into the sandbox via
``subprocess.Popen(pass_fds=...)``. Bubblewrap's user command path
never closes arbitrary inherited fds (only its own monitor/PID-1 paths
do), so the listener fd flows naturally through the bwrap → launcher
chain. The daemon recovers the fd from ``JIUWENBOX_CONTROL_LISTENER_FD``
and ``accept()``s against it. This keeps the IPC channel entirely
outside any sandbox-visible path, so user code spawned by the daemon
cannot reach (or delete) the listener.

Important security notes:

* Sandboxed payloads share the daemon's UID (typically ``nobody``).  The
  kernel's PID-1 signal protections are not sufficient on every platform,
  so seccomp additionally blocks ``kill``/``tkill``/``tgkill`` targeting
  infrastructure PIDs (1/2, process group, or broadcast).  Each user exec
  also runs in its own session so ``kill(0)`` cannot reach the daemon.

* Box-server shuts the daemon down via the ``shutdown`` IPC command
  (graceful) or ``SIGKILL`` from outside the namespace (forced).

* Children are spawned via :func:`subprocess.Popen` so the kernel does
  the standard ``fork``/``execve`` pair. The seccomp BPF filter and
  Landlock ruleset that bwrap and the launcher installed before running
  the daemon are inherited by every child - they cannot be relaxed or
  stripped from inside the sandbox. ``close_fds=True`` (the Python
  default) ensures the listener fd is **not** inherited by user code.

The module deliberately stays standard-library-only so it can be
launched with ``python3 -S`` (no ``import site``) for fastest cold
start, and so the launcher's ``compile``/``exec`` step does not need to
reach outside the standard library to load the daemon.

    # initialised process, so the interpreter name does not select a different
    # binary -- the worker IS the interpreter that runs the code. Two rules
    # follow from that, both measured against the real interpreter in-sandbox:
    #
    #   * ``python3 -c`` is equivalent by construction (the worker is the
    #     daemon's ``python3``). ``python -c`` is equivalent only when the
    #     bare ``python`` on PATH resolves to that same interpreter; if
    #     ``python`` were python2 / a venv / a wrapper, the fast path would
    #     silently run its code under python3, so it must fall back (the same
    #     identity check the script path uses). ``python3 -c`` keeps its
    #     released behaviour and is not identity-checked (no regression).
    #   * The worker's ``sys.flags`` and startup are fixed at worker spawn
    #     and cannot be changed per request. Any interpreter flag before
    #     ``-c`` (``-I`` / ``-S`` / ``-E`` / ``-u`` / ``-B`` ...) changes
    #     observable ``sys.flags`` or buffering/startup that the worker
    #     cannot reproduce, so a flagged ``-c`` must not take the code fast
    #     path. (Previously every flag was silently dropped and
    #     the request still hit -- e.g. ``python3 -I -c`` ran with
    #     ``sys.flags.isolated == 0``.)
    #
    # Code mode is therefore exactly the bare ``python[3] -c CODE``: ``-c``
    # must be the first token after the interpreter. A ``-c`` that appears
    # later belongs to a script's argv, not to the interpreter, and a flag
    # before it is not preservable -- both fall through to script mode,

class FastPathStats:
    """Minimal thread-safe fast-path observability counters.

    Counters are kept in memory and mirrored (throttled) to a JSON snapshot
    at ``/tmp/fastpath_stats.json`` inside the sandbox so host-side tooling
    and the perf scripts can read them through the normal exec/files path -
    no new API surface. Purely diagnostic; never used for control flow.

    Counting口径 (daemon-side, single source of truth):

    * ``requests``  -- exec requests the daemon actually *judged*, i.e. that
      entered ``_try_fastpath_exec`` (server-marked candidates the admit cap
      let through). NOT total server candidates: server-side admit-cap drops
      never reach the daemon and are not represented here.
    * ``hits``      -- judged requests the fast path executed to a *normal*
      ``exit_code`` response (``"error" not in response``).
    * ``fallbacks`` -- judged requests that did not hit, broken down by
      ``fallback_reasons``: ``not_eligible`` / ``nonempty_stdin`` /
      ``breaker_open`` / ``capacity_busy`` / ``worker_unavailable`` /
      ``spawn_failed`` / ``worker_error`` / ``exec_uncertain``.
      ``exec_uncertain`` is a *post-dispatch* failure: the
      request was sent to a worker and the code may have run, so the daemon
      reports an explicit failure instead of replaying via ``subprocess.Popen``.
      All other reasons are *pre-dispatch* (safe Popen fallback).

    Invariant: ``requests == hits + fallbacks`` (every judged request lands in
    exactly one bucket). ``record_request`` is taken at the *entry* of
    ``_try_fastpath_exec`` (before the eligibility check) so ``not_eligible``
    is counted; ``record_hit`` is only taken on a normal worker response, so
    a ``worker_error`` response is a fallback, never also a hit.

    Throttle / eventual flush: ``write_snapshot`` writes at most once per
    ``FASTPATH_STATS_THROTTLE``; a skipped write sets ``_dirty`` so the next
    in-window record or the 5s idle-reaper wakeup (``flush``) force-writes
    the accumulated counters. A one-off fallback followed by silence is
    therefore never permanently lost.

    the same cgroup, seccomp, Landlock and mount envelope. Simple round-robin

    requests concurrently. The pool lock only guards pool state (spawn/prune/

      availability concern, not a security-boundary breach.
    * **Circuit breaker**: after ``FASTPATH_BREAKER_THRESHOLD`` consecutive
      failures (worker death, spawn failure, protocol error) the breaker
      opens and fast-path requests fall straight back to ``/exec`` with no
      worker churn for ``FASTPATH_BREAKER_COOLDOWN`` seconds, then one

    * **Idle recycle**: after ``FASTPATH_IDLE_TIMEOUT`` seconds of no fast
      path activity the pool recycles to zero workers (background reaper).

    by the time the daemon runs, the fd is already in our process and
