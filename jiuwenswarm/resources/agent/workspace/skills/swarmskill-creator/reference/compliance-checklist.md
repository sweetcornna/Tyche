# Compliance Checklist

> Read in **Stage 6** after the validator script passes. The script catches structural / frontmatter / section-presence / cross-file errors. This checklist catches **judgment calls the script cannot automate** — the responsibility-attribution tests that decide whether new fields belong in the spec, plus content-quality checks.

## What the validator script catches (do not duplicate here)

The validator handles two output shapes:

**Full Markdown spec**
- Five-file structure (`SKILL.md` / `roles/` / `workflow.md` / `bind.md` / `dependencies.yaml`)
- Frontmatter required fields (`name`, `description`, `version`, `kind: swarm-skill`, `roles[]`)
- Each `roles[].id` has matching `roles/<id>.md`
- Each role file has the 5 mandatory sections
- Each Identity starts with `> *"..."*`
- `workflow.md` has Overview/Detailed Steps/Acceptance Criteria + at least one mermaid block
- `bind.md` has Resource Constraints / Behavioral Constraints / Failure Handling
- `dependencies.yaml` has both `skills:` and `tools:` segments
- Every `roles[].skills` and `roles[].tools` declared in SKILL.md appears in dependencies.yaml

**Script-only SwarmFlow**
- Minimal `SKILL.md` + `scripts/workflow.py`
- No `roles/`, `workflow.md`, `bind.md`, `dependencies.yaml`, or `prompts/`
- Executable `scripts/workflow.py` safety envelope

The full SwarmFlow script authoring constraints live in [templates/scripts/workflow.py.template](../templates/scripts/workflow.py.template) under `TEMPLATE AUTHORING CONSTRAINTS`. Do not duplicate that list here. If the script reports failures, fix them first. **This checklist starts where the script ends.**

## Part A: Responsibility-attribution tests

For each new section / field / rule you introduce beyond the templates, run these tests. Any candidate that fails one or more tests should be rejected or moved out of the spec.

### Test 1 — Consumer-and-time check (run BEFORE any redundancy claim)

Before declaring two things "redundant", verify their **consumers and timing** are the same.

- `description` (system-prompt-time, decides trigger) vs `## Workflow` (already-triggered Agent reading body) → different consumers → NOT redundant.
- `## Workflow` in SKILL.md (prose summary) vs `workflow.md` (full mermaid + steps) → same consumer (Leader), different depth → NOT redundant; SKILL.md links to workflow.md.
- mermaid in SKILL.md body vs mermaid in workflow.md → SAME consumer (reader visualizing flow) → REDUNDANT → keep only in workflow.md.

### Test 2 — Registry / store concern?

If the candidate field is about discovery, recommendation, download counts, tier, popularity → **registry concern, not Swarm Skill spec**. Examples: `tier`, `downloads`, `category` for browsing.

### Test 3 — Runtime / framework concern?

If the candidate field is about how the framework wires dependencies, dispatches teammates, or implements messaging → **framework concern, not Swarm Skill spec**. Examples: `teammate_mode`, `install_command`, message format. The Swarm Skill MAY declare a **preference order** for inter-member communication (e.g., direct peer-to-peer > shared blackboard > Leader-relay), but MUST NOT mandate a specific mechanism.

### Test 4 — Tutorial / docs concern?

If the candidate content is long-form examples, anti-patterns, common pitfalls — and it's NOT actionable at runtime → **docs concern**. Move to `examples/` directory or external README. **Exception**: short bullet-style guidance in templates is fine.

### Test 5 — Already in git / filesystem metadata?

If the candidate field is mtime, author, commit history, file size → **already in git / FS**. Do not duplicate.

### Test 6 — Already defined elsewhere?

After Test 1 (consumer-and-time check), if two locations carry the same content for the same consumer at the same time → keep one, delete the other.

### Test 7 — Internal implementation leaking?

If the candidate field exposes session IDs, internal trace handles, framework-specific identifiers → **leak**. Hide it.

### Test 8 — Machine-verifiable?

If the field is purely human-written prose with no machine-checkable correctness → **risky**. Keep only if the value-to-verifiability ratio is high. Most natural-language sections are accepted because their value is high; new fields should justify themselves.

### Test 9 — Future-use safety net

Before deleting a long-unused field, consider whether a planned future field would give it new purpose. Leave it as **optional** if uncertain. Do not judge a field in isolation when the surrounding spec is still evolving.

## Part B: Content-quality manual checks (judgement calls)

The validator confirms structure exists. These checks confirm the structure is **good**:

### B1. Identity mottos — anti-convergence

Read all role mottos as a list. Apply this test:

> *"If I shuffled these mottos and asked a reader to assign each motto to a role file, could they do it correctly without context?"*

If yes → mottos are distinctive. If no → roles will converge in output. Rewrite the offending mottos using [role-design.md](role-design.md) § Anti-convergence techniques.

### B2. Boundary completeness

For each role, read its `Boundary` and ask:

- **Forbidden**: does the list mention every sibling role's territory? (For A/B patterns where overlap is the risk.)
- **Mandatory**: does the list prevent silent under-delivery? (For roles that might output "looks fine" or skip slices.)

A `Boundary` with only Forbidden tends to produce empty findings. A `Boundary` with only Mandatory tends to produce role overlap. Both halves work as opposing forces.

### B3. Inline Persona self-containment

For each role's `## Inline Persona for Teammate`, do this test:

> *"If I copy-pasted this prompt verbatim into a fresh agent with no other context, could it produce a valid output that matches the schema?"*

Common gaps:
- Persona references "the team" or "the Leader" without explaining → opaque to a teammate
- Persona mentions methodology (STRIDE, SCQA) without defining it → teammate might not know it
- Placeholders like `{INPUT}` are present but not labeled → unclear what to fill in
- Output format described in prose but not shown as a literal template → teammate guesses structure

### B4. Workflow gates have teeth

For each step in `workflow.md > Detailed Steps`, verify:

- The step has a **quality gate** declared (pass criteria + fail action).
- The fail action is **specific** ("retry once, then mark missing in report" — not "handle failure").
- For C-pattern stage transitions, `bind.md` declares "Stage N+1 MUST refuse to start if gate FAIL".

A workflow without enforceable gates is just prose; the team will skip steps under load.

### B5. Bind numbers are real

Check `bind.md > Resource Constraints` numbers against the workflow:

- `max_parallel_teammates` ≥ the largest parallel fan-out in the mermaid diagram
- `total_wall_clock_budget` ≥ sum of sequential stage budgets
- `total_token_budget` ≥ rough estimate of (per-role tokens × N roles)

Numbers that don't match the workflow are theater.

### B6. Failure handling covers both required scenarios

`Failure Handling` MUST cover:

- (a) **Teammate failure** — timeout, malformed output, retry policy, missing-output reporting
- (b) **Input over-scale degradation** — what triggers degraded mode, what the degraded mode does, how the user is warned

Re-read your `Failure Handling` and confirm both are present. Most authoring errors omit (b).

### B7. dependencies.yaml has user-facing `purpose` lines

Each `skills[]` and `tools[]` entry has a `purpose` field that is **human-readable** and **explains the consequence of missing**:

- Good: `purpose: locate symbols and call sites in the diff`
- Bad: `purpose: code-search dependency`
- Bad: `purpose: required for the skill`

The `purpose` field is shown to the user during pre-flight checks when a dependency is missing. Write it for that audience.

### B8. SKILL.md description is a real trigger

Read the `description` and ask:

- Does it state **WHEN** to use? ("Use when: ...")
- Does it state **WHEN NOT** to use? ("DO NOT use for: ...")
- Does it list 1–3 **trigger phrases** that the agent should recognize?
- Is it 1–5 lines (system prompts hard-cap descriptions)?

A description that omits "when not to use" causes the skill to over-trigger. A description without trigger phrases causes the skill to under-trigger.

### B9. SwarmFlow barriers are justified

For every `parallel(...)` barrier, ask:

- Does the next step genuinely need all prior results together?
- If each item can continue independently, is the barrier adding avoidable latency?
- Does the final report make partial branch failure visible to the user?

A barrier is a latency cost. Use it only when it carries real cross-item semantics.

### B10. Dynamic fan-out has explicit bounds

For every dynamic fan-out or loop over user-provided input, confirm:

- The chosen bound is meaningful for the task size, not an arbitrary silent cap.
- Skipped or truncated work is visible in the returned result or user-facing report.
- Empty input produces a clear skip/degraded outcome, not a misleading success.

The validator can warn on suspicious shapes; it cannot judge whether the bound is correct for the user's domain.

### B11. Runtime values are injected, not discovered

If validator warnings around time, randomization, or file access are intentionally accepted, confirm:

- The workflow explains why the runtime value cannot be supplied through `args` or runtime-provided data.
- Resume, journal replay, and cache behavior remain understandable.
- The final sign-off names the accepted warning instead of silently ignoring it.

Unexplained runtime discovery makes replay and cache behavior hard to reason about.

### B12. Semantic success is stronger than schema success

For every integration/final result, verify:

- The chosen success fields actually prove the answer is useful for this workflow.
- Empty-but-schema-valid outputs cannot be reported as complete success.
- Missing teammate outputs are visible in the returned result or user-facing report.

Schema shape only proves the container exists; it does not prove the answer is useful.

### B13. Child workflow composition is justified

For every `workflow(...)` call, verify:

- The final value is an absolute `.py` path. It is derived from the installed
  parent's `Path(__file__).resolve()` location (or is an explicitly supplied,
  validated external path), not from cwd, a bare Skill name, a relative path,
  `~/.jiuwenswarm`, or a machine-specific user directory.
- The referenced child script already exists and its independent journal namespace is useful.
- The parent-to-child call is the only composition level; the child does not call
  another workflow, and deeper designs have been flattened.
- Ordinary shared code remains a helper function instead of becoming a child workflow.
- Parallel children either tolerate shared-budget competition or receive explicit per-child limits through args.

Sub-workflows are execution boundaries, not a general-purpose code reuse mechanism.

### B14. Budget scaling leaves room to finish

For every budget-dependent loop or fan-out, verify:

- The no-budget fallback is bounded independently and cannot create an unbounded loop or fan-out.
- The remaining-token threshold reserves enough capacity for integration and the final report.
- Work skipped because of the budget is visible in the returned result.
- Child workflows rely on the shared parent ledger rather than inventing a second budget source.

A syntactically guarded budget policy can still spend everything before producing a usable answer.

### B15. Workflow token limits come from the user

If `META.workflow_token_limit` is present, confirm that its exact value came
from an explicit user instruction for this workflow's per-run ceiling. Do not
accept an AI estimate, a default, or a value derived from another budget. If the
user did not specify a limit, confirm that the field is absent.

## Part C: Cross-Swarm-Skill consistency (only when publishing multiple together)

When publishing a batch of Swarm Skills as a coherent set:

- [ ] Naming convention: all Swarm Skills end with `-swarm` suffix
- [ ] Frontmatter `version` consistent across the batch
- [ ] Description structure follows the same template ("Use when..." / "DO NOT use for..." / "Triggers...")
- [ ] No two Swarm Skills overlap in trigger conditions (they would compete in the trigger system)
- [ ] All Swarm Skills produce structurally similar Final Reports (tiered, schema-based) so users learn one mental model

Cross-Swarm-Skill consistency is a usability concern, not a per-skill compliance rule.

---

## Final sign-off ritual

Once all above checks pass, write a 2-line sign-off in the conversation (not in any file):

```
Swarm Skill: <name>
Pattern: <A | B | C | A+B | B+C | C+A | C+B+A | Debate>
Roles: <count> (<list of role ids>)
Validator: PASS
Manual checks: PASS (all responsibility-attribution and content-quality tests)
Justification: <1-line Stage 0 reason this team beats single-agent>
```

This forces a final articulation of the Swarm Skill's reason to exist.
