# Runtime Session

## Responsibility

Owns the process-local product Session execution lifecycle behind `AgentRuntime`: registration, persisted single-Agent restoration, per-Session chat and cross-Session message scheduling, Goal and control execution registration, exact interaction delivery, execution lookup, bounded terminal retention, cancellation/wait, generation-safe close, stream producer ownership, and Runtime shutdown ordering. Durable metadata and history remain in the existing stores.

## Current Boundary

- Foreground `agent.work.normal` and `agent.code.normal` chat, Goal, Goal attach, follow-up, steer, and interaction-answer requests use this Runtime from Process CLI and AgentServer; Web, TUI, ACP, and IM transports share that AgentServer boundary without owning Session execution state.
- Plan, Team, and background requests retain their distinct executors until their modules adapt.
- Runtime schedules ordinary chat in the Session lane. Goal stream/control/attach and control input are registered executions but run outside that lane because Goal scheduling, output lease, and `control_lock` remain owned by the Goal SDK. The facade continues to own history, MCP, memory, A2UI, and adapter semantics.
- An interaction event records its concrete request/interaction ID and moves an ended output round to `WAITING_FOR_CONTROL`. Its answer claims only the execution carrying that exact ID, records the parent relationship, and enters the existing adapter without creating a second chat turn or persistence owner. Goal and chat interactions may therefore coexist safely in one Session.
- `AgentRuntime.send_session_message` resolves source and target from persisted metadata, requires a persisted target channel and exactly matching owners, idempotently restores and registers an unloaded Work/Code Normal target, and returns after queuing a `SESSION_MESSAGE` execution. A ready target starts a new turn; a target waiting for control retains that interaction and releases queued messages only after the exact control owner completes or is cancelled. Session messages are FIFO and do not supersede waiting work.
- Callers must create, resume, or explicitly register a Session before managed execution. Unsupported modes fail at the Runtime boundary instead of falling back.
- The package-level product API is deliberately narrow: `jiuwenswarm.runtime` exports only `AgentRuntime` and `RuntimeStateError`. Coordinator ownership, Session adoption helpers, request classification helpers, and execution queries remain implementation details behind `AgentRuntime`; provisioning transaction contracts live in the explicit `jiuwenswarm.runtime.session_provisioner` submodule.

## Entry Points And Symbols

- `jiuwenswarm/runtime/__init__.py`: product imports for `AgentRuntime` and `RuntimeStateError` only.
- `jiuwenswarm/runtime/session/coordinator.py`: package-internal `RuntimeSessionCoordinator` run/cancel/close/query surface.
- `jiuwenswarm/runtime/session/work_scheduler.py`: `SessionWorkScheduler` and generation-owned lanes.
- `jiuwenswarm/runtime/session/execution_registry.py`: `SessionExecutionRegistry` and bounded indexes.
- `jiuwenswarm/runtime/session/model.py`: Session and Execution models/results.
- `jiuwenswarm/runtime/service.py`: managed routing, executor selection, and lifecycle ordering.
- `jiuwenswarm/runtime/session_provisioner.py`: explicit create/switch/fork/delete provisioning contracts and implementation.
- `jiuwenswarm/channels/process_cli/client.py`: in-process reference entry.
- `jiuwenswarm/server/agent_ws_server.py`: AgentServer registration and transport boundary.

## Follow-On Ownership

Adapter, provisioning, repository, delivery, lifecycle-resource, Team, and background modules adapt in that dependency order. Lifecycle contracts are introduced with their first real implementation rather than kept as unused scaffolding. Once all callers use the Runtime facts, the facade `SessionManager`, AgentServer `_session_stream_tasks`, broad AgentManager scans, global product delivery route, prefix-based persistence inference, and migration modes are removed. The `InProcessRuntimeClient` reference chain remains permanent.

## Verification

Deterministic tests cover Work/Code unary and stream routing, persisted target restoration, idle target message execution, FIFO message delivery after interaction control, message idempotency and cancellation, Goal classification, Goal/chat concurrency, Goal close cancellation, exact interaction matching, same-Session chat ordering, cross-Session concurrency, repeated interaction suspension, stale-control rejection, external stream cancellation, stream early close, resistant cancellation, generation isolation, ContextVar propagation, and shutdown. Configured-model system gates complete real chat and Goal `ask_user` rounds whose first streams end before the answer, then restore unloaded Work and Code targets through a fresh Runtime and verify cross-Session output persistence and terminal execution state.

The 2026-09-10 full affected-scope verification passed all four configured-model gates, the real AgentServer/Gateway WebSocket route, 72 focused Web Session tests, and the complete TUI frontend build/test suite. Repository contract suites for Feishu, Slack, and the remaining IM transports passed. Live vendor API validation still requires external provider credentials. The repository-wide Web build currently has an unrelated unresolved `onnxruntime-web/wasm` dependency, and broad Windows runs retain documented upstream baseline failures outside this module.
