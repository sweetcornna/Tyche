"""The default config template must cover the keys the project itself ships.

``jiuwenswarm/resources/config.yaml`` is not only a defaults file. It is the
set of keys ``migrate_config_from_template`` accounts for when it projects an
operator's config through the template: ``_deep_merge`` walks the template's
keys, so an option the template does not name has no default to hand down and
nothing in the merge that knows it exists. That merge runs at import of
``jiuwenswarm/app.py``, ``gateway/app_gateway.py`` and
``server/app_agentserver.py``, which means it runs on every service start.

So an option added to the code without a line in this template is not merely
undocumented. It reaches no fresh installation, because ``prepare_workspace``
copies this file verbatim; it never reaches a config written before the option
existed, because the merge has nothing to add; and it is the shape of key a
merge that cleans up after retired options takes back out of the operator's
file. The losses this module was written after were exactly that, and they
happened quietly, between one restart and the next, in a file the operator had
edited by hand.

The measurement is made against the files themselves rather than by running
the merge. What is being asked is "which options does a shipped config set
that this template fails to account for", and that is a question about the two
documents. Asking it of the files keeps the answer stable whatever the merge
later decides to do with a key it has no default for, and it does not
reproduce the merge's recursion bound: a key deep enough that the merge stops
short is still a key the template does not name.

There is no way to ask the source "which config paths does this read": the
reads are ``dict.get`` calls on sub-dicts assembled at runtime, sometimes
forwarded wholesale into a dataclass or a pydantic model that decides for
itself which names it recognises. What can be checked is the project's own
configuration files. The distributed-team configs and the yuanrong deployment
template are full configs maintained beside the code, and in practice a new
option reaches one of them at about the time it reaches the code. Every key
they carry that the default template omits is therefore either a gap in the
template or a divergence with a reason.

This module asserts the list of divergences exactly, in both directions:
an unexplained one fails, and so does an entry that no longer diverges. The
second half is what stops the list from quietly becoming the specification.

What this does NOT catch, stated plainly so nobody reads more into a pass:

* an option read by the code and written into no shipped config at all --
  nothing here can see it;
* a key only an operator ever sets, which is the case that caused the losses
  this module was written after;
* a key present in the template but read under a different name.

For the neighbouring property -- that an open-ended map is shipped bare rather
than as ``{}`` -- see ``TestTemplatesShipOpenEndedMapsBare`` in
``test_config_open_ended_maps.py``.

One test does run the migration, because a rename is only a rename if the
value arrives. It is given both paths explicitly --
``migrate_config_from_template(template_path, user_config_path)`` -- and
``user_config_path`` is always inside pytest's ``tmp_path``. No test in this
module may call the no-argument ``ensure_config_migrated_from_template()``
instead. That wrapper resolves the running installation's workspace and
rewrites the config file it finds there, so a later edit reaching for the
convenient call would destroy the developer's own configuration -- which is
the defect this module exists to describe.
